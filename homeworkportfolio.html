    <h1> This is my Homework Portfolio</h1>
                                                 

    <!-- A div that contains a group of items for week 1. Can be useful for setting background colours etc.  -->
<div class="myWeek1">
        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <h3>GDP</h3>
        <p>This first chart tracks UK GDP over time.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>GNI</h3>
        <p>My second chart looks at GNI in the UK</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
</div>
 

<div class="myWeek2">
        <h1>Week 2</h1> 
        <h3>IMF Lending</h3>
        <p>This chart hosts CSV data on IMF lending.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>

        <h3>IMF Lending relative to GDP</h3>
        <p>This chart divides the data above through by GDP to show IMF lending as a percentage of GDP.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        <p>During this period, the IMF lent most in 1984 (relative to GDP), suggesting that this was a riskier year to invest in than today, when lending is at a peak only in absolute terms.</p>
</div> 

<div class="myWeek3">
        <h1>Week 3</h1> 
        <h3>Life expectancy</h3>
        <p>This chart embeds data on life expectancy into a chart specification. In other words, the data source is defined inline. I did this by converting CSV cell data into a dictionaries format.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>

<p>I then modified this chart, switching it from a stacked area chart to a line chart.</p> 
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div> 
<p>The second chart is much more appropriate for showing life expectancy data because it allows the viewer to easily compare continents with each other. The sum of total life expectancies is not useful information so stacking the data is unnecessary in the first chart.</p>
</div>


<div class="myWeek4">
        <h1>Week 4</h1> 
        <h3>Olympic Medals</h3>
        <p>This chart shows data that I retrieved from the Olympics website using a scraper in python. The code I wrote to do this can be seen 
            <a href="https://github.com/jesme00/jesme00.github.io/blob/main/Week4HomeworkScraper.ipynb" id="link4">here. 
            </a> I chose to scrape from this website because it was intuitive to inspect and the countries were already named clearly, not needing to be changed from, for example, abbreviations or caps lock.
            </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"></div>
</div>


<div class="myWeek5">
        <h1>Week 5</h1> 
        <h3>ONS Time Series Data</h3>
        <p>To start this homework, I used loop code and an API from class to batch download time series data from FRED. The python notebook I used to do this can be seen
            <a href="https://github.com/jesme00/jesme00.github.io/blob/main/Week5HomeworkFRED.ipynb" id="link4">here.
            </a> Then, using what I learnt in class from downloading this FRED data, I applied my knowledge to batch download data from the ONS. The code I wrote to do this can be seen 
            <a href="https://github.com/jesme00/jesme00.github.io/blob/main/Week5HomeworkONS.ipynb" id="link4">here.
            </a> This allowed me to very quickly generate 9 json files which could then be used to display 9 charts after copying the code into Vega to define the x and y axes.

<div class="myWeek7">
        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <h3>Maps</h3>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart17"></div>
        <p>The map below of England shows the rate of adults classified as overweight or obese, by local authority. Note it uses the same base map as above, but weight data is not available for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart18"></div>

</div>

<div class="myWeek8">
        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        <h3>Festival of Economics</h3>
<p>The topic of the talk I attended at the Festival of Economics was 'Prices and Wages', where speakers discussed how inflation has reached an all time high, but that the prices of individual components that make up this indicator vary at significantly different rates.  The chart below is supporting evidence of how much prices have increased in recent years as given by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart19"></div>
<p>The chart below looks at one component that makes up the CPI, Milk, Cheese and Eggs. Comparing the 2020-2023 period in the two charts gives one supporting example of how particular essentials have seen their average price rise much faster in recent times than the average rate of prices across the wider economy.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart20"></div>
</div>


<div class="myWeek9">
        <h1>Week 9</h1>
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>The first chart I have made uses unsupervised classification to group wines from 3 different growers into distinct groups based on 13 different attributes, such as colour, hue, alcohol content and acidity. The code I wrote to run the dimensionality reduction in order to produce this clustered scatter plot can be seen in this Colab notebook <a href="https://github.com/jesme00/jesme00.github.io/blob/main/W10HomeworkWine.ipynb" id="link4">here.</a></p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart21"></div>
<p>The second chart I have made uses supervised regression to plot English local authority use of outdoor space against their respective obesity rates. Surprisingly, there is a positive relationship, but a very weak one as given by the low R squared value and the large shaded area over which the line of best fit could be placed. The Colab notebook I used to run this regression is available <a href="https://github.com/jesme00/jesme00.github.io/blob/main/SupervisedLearningRegression.ipynb" id="link4">here.</a></p>
