<h1>Are we missing a trick in tackling obesity?</h1>
    
    <!-- A div that contains a group of items for week 1. Can be useful for setting background colours etc.  -->
    <div class="myWeek1">     
        <h3>Obesity was historically considered an individual's health problem owing to poor diet and little exercise. Today there is growing evidence around its impact on society and the economy, where it has been found to reduce productivity, cost the NHS millions each year, and negatively affect the health of generations to come. How can we stop this?</h3> 
        <p2>Income is often cited as a key determinant of weight besides lifestyle (because healthy diets are expensive), and this has led to government schemes such as Health Start Vouchers for low income households with young children to buy fruit and vegetables with. And yet the map below demonstrates the relative unsuccessful nature of efforts made so far, becoming increasingly darker between 2015 and 2020, where even areas with the lowest proportions of overweight adults have continuously averaged above 30%.     
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>         
        <br>The aim of this project is to see if there are there any surprisingly weak or surprisingly strong correlations between weight and other variables, that we might want to pay closer attention to when evaluating how best to go about solving this socioeconomic problem.</p2>

        <h3>Fast food outlet density</h3>
        <p>Blah blah blah.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="myWeek3"> 
        <h3>Fast food outlet density and weight - is there a correlation?</h3>
        <p>Blah blah blah.</p>
        <p2>Although there is a positive correlation between outlet density and weight of the local population, the relationship is weak, as shown by the R squared value that indicates only 6% of the variation in obesity rates can be explained by how many outlets there are in an area. It therefore seems the built environment has negligible influence on the health of its residents.</p2>
